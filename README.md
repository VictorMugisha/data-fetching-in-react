# Data Fetching in React

In this project, I've implemented manual data fetching in React including how to handle different states of fetching such as:
    1. Handling loading state
    2. Handling error (not errors actually, but how to react in case you have errors in your application)
    3. Handling race conditions using AbortController and so on...
